# shogun-breakdown
Tool to capture and analyze runs in Shogun Showdown

TODO:
list shops
list rewards
fully flesh out enums
capture history
room totals
identify victory (lol (lol how easy with the prediction approach))

QUESTIONS
does two-way warrior work with signature move (tile)?
enemy attack order
potion pickup order

IDEAS:
get to the actors with only trap, thorns, scar strike (other?) to see what happens if they can't copy anything
