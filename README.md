# shogun-breakdown
Tool to capture and analyze runs in Shogun Showdown

TODO:
fully flesh out enums
capture history
POTIONS :|
room totals
identify victory (lol (lol how easy with the prediction approach))
pickup everything at battle end
corrupted wave exists only in memory
trap too :|
make sure combos and friendlies are correct at the end of battle too
TODO: friendly kill only counts if attacker or direct target have been moved by hero
TODO swaps die after being swapped

QUESTIONS
does two-way warrior work with signature move (tile)?
enemy attack order
potion pickup order
can you use shield when having shield

IDEAS:
get to the actors with only trap, thorns, scar strike (other?) to see what happens if they can't copy anything
if given no other choice will the shielder shield trap or thorns
