TO-DO CENTRAL

fully flesh out enums
capture history
POTIONS :|
room totals
identify victory (lol (lol how easy with the prediction approach))
pickup everything at battle end
make sure combos and friendlies are correct at the end of battle too
TODO: friendly kill only counts if attacker or direct target have been moved by hero
# new theory: this only works if attacker/target have moved, in any way
when is the deck chakram reset/upped?
when shogun defeated, count all present for chakram and update room accordingly
capture where in shogun fight we are
